### Mika Hiltunen 의 사용자 경험에 대한 정의

According to Hiltunen et al., (2002) the components of user experience can be grouped into
five categories, which are utility, usability, availability, aesthetics and offline issues. They
argue that user experience could be present as a multiplication equation:

```User experience (UX) = Utility × Usability × Availability × Aesthetics × Offline issues```

* __Utility__ - The user perceives the service as providing the kind of services that he or she finds valuable
* __Usability__ - The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use. (ISO 9241-11)
* __Availability__ - The service is available when expected and unavailable follows a predictable pattern.
* __Aesthetics__ - The user finds the look and feel of the service appealing.
* __Offline issues__ - This is an umbrella category containing such things as brand,  *i.e.* what company is providing the service and the supporting backend business processes, *e.g.* how quickly net store can deliver.
