Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### 여섯 가지 미덕과 폐단\r\n\r\n```\r\n인을 좋아하면서도 배우기를 좋아하지 않으면 우매함에 이르게 되고\r\n지혜를 좋아하면서도 배우기를 좋아하지 않으면 방탕에 이르게 되고\r\n믿음을 좋아하면서도 배우기를 좋아하지 않으면 속아서 스스로를 해치게 되고\r\n정직을 좋아하면서도 배우기를 좋아하지 않으면 예기치 못한 실수를 하게 되고\r\n용맹을 좋아하면서도 배우기를 좋아하지 않으면 화를 자초하게 되며\r\n강직함을 좋아하면서도 배우기를 좋아하지 않으면 멋대로 구는 병폐에 빠지게 된다.\r\n```\r\n\r\n공자, 논어, 제17 양화편 8장\r\n\r\n### Mika Hiltunen 의 사용자 경험에 대한 정의\r\nAccording to Hiltunen et al., (2002) the components of user experience can be grouped into\r\nfive categories, which are utility, usability, availability, aesthetics and offline issues. They\r\nargue that user experience could be present as a multiplication equation:\r\n\r\n```User experience (UX) = Utility × Usability × Availability × Aesthetics × Offline issues```\r\n\r\n* __Utility__ - The user perceives the service as providing the kind of services that he or she finds valuable\r\n* __Usability__ - The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use. (ISO 9241-11)\r\n* __Availability__ - The service is available when expected and unavailable follows a predictable pattern.\r\n* __Aesthetics__ - The user finds the look and feel of the service appealing.\r\n* __Offline issues__ - This is an umbrella category containing such things as brand,  _i.e._ what company is providing the service and the supporting backend business processes, _e.g._ how quickly net store can deliver.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
